The fact we need to accept is that every software we made contain (one or many) risk. The risk (is caused by bug and fault) may be small and the consequences unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catastrophic. But with testing, we can find out bug(s) and fault(s). Therefor, the risk is reduced. However, we can not make the risk equal to zero because it impossible.
