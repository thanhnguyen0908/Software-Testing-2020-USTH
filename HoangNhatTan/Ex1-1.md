- Level 2 testing, the purpose is to show failures 
  Looking for failures is a negative activity
- Level 3 testing shows the presence, not absence or failure. If we use software, we expose some risk. 
- Level 4 testing means that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to produce high quality software.
  A mental discipline that increases quality:
  + Test engineers can become technical leaders of the project
- So from those describe above we can think of some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizer’s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)  like : 
	+ experience
	+ responsibility
	+ expertise
	+ technical
	+ skills 
	+ Good teamwork and communication to lead
