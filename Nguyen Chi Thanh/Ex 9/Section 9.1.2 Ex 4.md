4. Consider the following BNF:

A ::= O B | O M | O B M

c) Write two strings that are valid according to the BNF.

116 possible strings, including: wio, xf

d) For each of your two strings, give two valid mutants of the string. 

Dozens for each string.

wio −→ wit, mio

xr −→ xi, sf

e) For each of your two strings, give two invalid mutants of the string. 

Thousands for each string.
