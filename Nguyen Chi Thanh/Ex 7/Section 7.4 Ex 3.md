3.
b) Give the path in the graph followed by each test.

Answer:

• t1: [f1, f3, f5, f6]

• t2: [f1, f3, f4, f6]

• t3: [f1, f2]

• t4: [f1, f3, f4, f6]

• t5: [f1, f2, f3, f4, f6]

c) Find a minimal test set that achieves Node Coverage.

Answer:

Three possibilities: {t1, t2, t3}, {t1, t3, t4}, or {t1, t5}.

d) Find a minimal test set that achieves Edge Coverage.

Answer:

One possibility: {t1, t5}

e) Give the prime paths in the graph. Which prime path is not covered by any of the tests above?

Answer:
There are 4 prime paths: { [f1, f2, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f2, f3, f5, f6], [f1, f3, f4, f6], [f1, f3, f5, f6] }. 
The second of these paths is not covered by the given test paths.
